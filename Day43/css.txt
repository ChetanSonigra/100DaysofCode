--> CSS Selector: which part of html to apply styles.

tag = tagname {}
class = .classname{}   => can be applied to many elements
id = #id{}             => should be unique to each element
p[draggable]{}         => attribute selector - all p with attribute draggable = True
p[draggable="false"]{} => attribute selector based on value 
* {}                   => universal selector
